Dear TA,

Thank you for taking the time to review and grade our website. This guide is intended to assist you in testing the CRUD functionalities implemented in the Admin Panel of the website. The Admin Panel allows for the management of events and users, and we'd like to provide some guidance on how to effectively test these features.

## Testing Event Management CRUD Operations

### Creating an Event
1. Navigate to the 'Event Management' section.
2. Fill in the form fields with event details (Event ID, Title, Venue ID, Date, Description, Presenter, and Price).
3. Click the 'Create Event' button to add the event.
4. The new event should appear in the events table below.

### Updating an Event
1. Input the new details in the form fields at the top of the section (the same fields used for creating an event) first but don't create it.
2. Locate the event you wish to update in the events table.
3. Click the 'Update' button corresponding to the event in the table.
4. The event details in the table should now reflect the changes made.

### Deleting an Event
1. Find the event to be deleted in the events table.
2. Click the 'Delete' button next to the event.
3. The event should be removed from the table.

## Testing User Management CRUD Operations

### Creating a User
1. Go to the 'User Management' section.
2. Enter the new user's details in the form (Username and Password).
3. Click the 'Create User' button.
4. The new user should be listed in the users table below.

### Updating a User
1. Enter the updated username and/or password in the form fields (same as used for creating a user) first but don't create it.
2. Find the user you want to update in the users table.
3. Click the 'Update' button next to the user in the table.
4. The user's details in the table should update accordingly.

### Deleting a User
1. Locate the user to be deleted in the users table.
2. Click the 'Delete' button next to their name.
3. The user should be removed from the table.

Please note that the 'Create' and 'Update' operations for both events and users utilize the same form fields but are differentiated by whether you fill in the fields independently (for creation) or after selecting an existing item (for updates).

If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the functionalities, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
Niu Ka Ngai
